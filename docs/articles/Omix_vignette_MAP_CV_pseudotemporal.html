</h2>
<p>The goal of Omix is to provide tools in R to build a complete
analysis workflow for integrative analysis of data generated from
multi-omics platform.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Generate a multi-omics object using
<code>MultiAssayExperiment</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Quality control of single-omics data.</p></li>
<li><p>Formatting, normalisation, denoising of single-omics
data.</p></li>
<li><p>Separate single-omics analyses.</p></li>
<li><p>Integration of multi-omics data for combined analysis.</p></li>
<li><p>Publication quality plots and interactive analysis reports based
of shinyApp.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, Omix supports the integration of bulk transcriptomics and
bulk proteomics.</p>

<h3 id="running-omix">Running <em>Omix</em><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#running-omix"></a>
</h3>
<p>The <code>Omix</code> pipeline requires the following input:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>rawdata_rna</code>: A data-frame containing raw RNA count
with rownames as gene and colnames as samples.</p></li>
<li><p><code>rawdata_protein</code>: A data-frame containing protein
abundance with rownames as proteins and colnames as samples.</p></li>
<li><p><code>map_rna</code>: A data-frame of two columns named
<code>primary</code> and <code>colname</code> where primary should
contain unique sample name with a link to sample metadata and colname is
the column names of the <code>rawdata_rna</code> data-frame.</p></li>
<li><p><code>map_protein</code>: A data-frame of two columns named
<code>primary</code> and <code>colname</code> where primary should
contain unique sample name with a link to sample metadata and colname is
the column names of the <code>rawdata_protein</code>
data-frame.</p></li>
<li><p><code>metadata_rna</code>: A data-frame containing
<code>rna</code> assay specific metadata where rownames are same as the
colnames of <code>rawdata_rna</code> data.frame.</p></li>
<li><p><code>metadata_protein</code>: A data-frame containing
<code>protein</code> assay specific metadata where rownames are same as
the colnames of <code>rawdata_protein</code> data.frame.</p></li>
<li><p><code>individual_metadata</code>: A data-frame containing
individual level metadata for both omics assays.</p></li>

<p><strong>Omix</strong> supports a range of vertical integration
models:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Possible integration methods are
<code>MOFA</code>,<code>DIABLO</code>,<code>sMBPLS</code>,<code>iCluster</code>,<code>MEIFESTO</code></p></li>
<li><p>The choice of the integration models depends on the research use
case of interest.</p></li>
<li><p>Here we display the use of <strong>Omix</strong> on a popular
integration method, MOFA or Multi-Omics Factor analysis (Argelaguet et
al. 2018).</p></li>
<li><p>The <code>Meifesto</code>model is an extension of
<code>MOFA</code>to enable time as a covariate.</p></li>

<p>In this vignette, we proceed with a pseudotemporal multi-omics
integration of 40 brain Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Control samples
coming from two brain regions</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The somatosensory cortext (SSC)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The middle frontal gyrus (MTG)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The MTG is known to be affected earlier during AD progression, while
SSC at later stages. Using these two regions as pseudotemporal proxi in
the integrative process, we are able to gain a deeper understanding of
biological mechanisms that occur during AD progression.</p>

<p>The goal of <code>slingshot</code> (Street et al. 2017), is to use
clusters of cells to uncover global structure and convert this structure
into smooth lineages represented by one-dimensional variables, called
“pseudotime.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here, we extend the use of <code>slingshot</code> to infer on
individual level pseudotime to infer on Alzheimer’s disease
trajectory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>slingshot</code> takes a matrix of embeddings in reduced
dimension as input, which here are Factors 8 and 1 from the
<code>MEIFESTO</code> multi-omics integration. We can optionally specify
the cluster to start or end the trajectory based on biological
knowledge. Here, the starting cluster should be <code>3</code> as it
coincides with lowest neuropathology levels and most “recent” affected
region in terms of AD trajectory.</p>

weights<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#extract-features-that-are-driving-factor-6-based-on-feature-weights"></a>
</h3>
<p>Weights vary from -1 to +1, and provide a score for how strong each
feature relates to each factor, hence allowing a biological
interpretation of the latent factors. Features with no association with
the factor have values close to zero, while genes with strong
association with the factor have large absolute values.</p>
<p>The sign of the weight indicates the direction of the effect:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A positive weight indicates that the feature has higher levels in
the samples with positive factor values.</p></li>
<li><p>A negative weight indicate higher levels in samples with negative
factor values.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>extract_weigths</code>function enable to extract the
weights on the desired factor at a defined absolute threshold, and
return an object with positive and negative weights above and below this
threshold respectively. It also returns QC plots</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A distribution of the feature weights for each omic layer at the
designated factor</p></li>
<li><p>The relationship between the
feature/<code>sense_check_variable</code> correlation and weights. High
weights should coincide with stronger correlation if the
<code>sense_check_variable</code> is an important driver of variation in
the designated factor.</p></li>
