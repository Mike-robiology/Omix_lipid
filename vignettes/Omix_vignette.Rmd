## Overview

The goal of Omix is to provide tools in R to build a complete analysis workflow 
for integrative analysis of data generated from multi-omics platform.

-   Quality control of single-omics data.

-   Formatting, normalisation, denoising of single-omics data.

-   Separate single-omics analysis.

-   Integration of multi-omics data for combined analysis. 

-   Publication quality plots and interactive analysis reports based of shinyApp.

## Running *Omix*

The `Omix` pipeline requires the following input:

-   rawdata_rna: a data-frame containing raw RNA count with rownames as gene and colnames as samples.

-   rawdata_protein:  a data-frame containing protein abundance with rownames as proteins and colnames as samples.

-   map_rna: A data-frame of two columns named `primary` and `colname` where primary should contain unique sample name with a link to sample metadata and colname is the column names of the `rawdata_rna` data-frame.

-   map_protein: A data-frame of two columns named `primary` and `colname` where primary should contain unique sample name with a link to sample metadata and colname is the column names of the `rawdata_protein` data-frame. 

-   metadata_rna: A data-frame containing `rna` assay specific metadata where rownames are same as the colnames of `rawdata_rna` data.frame.

-   metadata_protein: A data-frame containing `protein` assay specific metadata where rownames are same as the colnames of `rawdata_protein` data.frame.

-   sample_metadata: A data-frame containing sample level metadata for both omics assays.
